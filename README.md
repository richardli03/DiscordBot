# DiscordBot
 Creating a discord bot!


Goals:
The bot will be able to detect whenever certain keywords are used in the chat and instantly ban

Server mods will be able to add new words to that list with the command !add ___

You can vote to ban certain users by typing
!votekick ____ [   ] which will display the following from the bot:

"A vote has been started to kick (user) from the server for the following reason: (reason). Please vote with either !kick (user) or !keep (user). At least 7 users must vote kick before the user is kicked"

Nightbot already basically does this, but this is learning for me!

Spam filter (autodelete messages that occur too many times)

3 strike system.


BTW // on the off chance you're maliciously trying to steal the token from the initial commit, it's changed :)
