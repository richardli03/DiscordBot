# DiscordBot
 Creating a discord bot!

START with: node index.js

# Goals:
The bot will be able to detect whenever certain keywords are used in the chat and instantly ban
Server mods will be able to add new words to that list with the command !add ___

You can vote to ban certain users by typing
!votekick ____ [   ]

Spam filter (autodelete messages that occur too many times)


# TODO:
1. How to store votes in votekick function?  
2. How to create the spam filter
3. Code hygiene :P
